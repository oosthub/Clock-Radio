# WiFi Connection Stability Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The ESP32 Internet Radio was losing WiFi connection when turned off for extended periods, requiring manual reconfiguration upon startup.

## Root Cause
- ESP32 WiFi enters power saving mode by default
- No connection monitoring or automatic reconnection logic
- Missing WiFi power management configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. WiFi Power Management (`configureWiFiPowerManagement()`)
```cpp
WiFi.setSleep(false);           // Disable WiFi sleep mode
WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true);    // Enable automatic reconnection  
WiFi.persistent(true);          // Keep WiFi credentials in flash
```

### 2. Connection Monitoring (in main loop)
- Check WiFi status every 30 seconds
- Attempt reconnection if connection lost (max every 60 seconds)
- Non-blocking reconnection with 15-second timeout
- Status logging every 10 minutes when connected

### 3. Applied Consistently
- After initial WiFi setup in `setup()`
- After manual WiFi configuration
- After automatic reconnection attempts

## Files Modified
- `src/main.cpp` - Added monitoring loop and power management setup
- `src/wifi_config.cpp` - Added power management function and configuration
- `include/wifi_config.h` - Added function declaration
- `WIFI_CONNECTION_TEST.md` - Testing documentation

## Expected Results
✅ WiFi stays connected when radio is "off" for extended periods  
✅ Automatic recovery from network interruptions  
✅ No manual reconfiguration needed after connection loss  
✅ System remains responsive during WiFi recovery  
✅ Works with existing sleep timer functionality  

## Testing
See `WIFI_CONNECTION_TEST.md` for detailed testing procedures.

## Key Benefits
- **Reliability**: WiFi connection maintained 24/7
- **User Experience**: No more manual reconfiguration
- **Automation**: Handles network outages gracefully
- **Performance**: Non-blocking implementation
- **Compatibility**: Works with all existing features

The implementation prioritizes connection stability over power consumption, which is appropriate for a mains-powered internet radio device.
